### Hi there 👋

### I'm currently working on my company called Bonfire Software, our current project is a secure P2P chat application.
### I'm currently learning Python, C, C++, HTML, and CSS. I have a handful to do for my next projects and these will be useful for them.
### I'm want someone to help me with my company, I have been doing everything by myself and it's hard for me. I can't pay but in the future it could give us a good resume.
### You can reach me by my Twitter @asherbuechel or Reddit u/cherishment213, MySpace @asher.buechel, Email pwned@bonfiresoftware.org
### I'm from Washington State.
### Fun Fact: Some fungi create zombies, then control their minds
